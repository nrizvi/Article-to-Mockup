Your response goes here!

* What new skills have you learned?
  
I learned about the horizontal rule! I did not know it existed. 

* What has been easy?
  
Formatting the paragraphs was pretty easy, because the spaces between them were pretty hard to miss.

* What has been difficult?
  
Looking for the smaller details, such as the superscript and the italic font. I overlooked them when I first started working on the project. I didn't realize, for example, that the "***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first two matches!***" was bold AND italic. I only made it bold at first, but after realizing something was off, realized it was meant to be italicized too!

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


They motivated me to finish this project! I was very nervous at first, but I only had to Google one thing (the superscript tag) and I was able to find it easily.
